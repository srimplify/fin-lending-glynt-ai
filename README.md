Solution to accelerate financial lending with APIs and AI

The U.S. government relief programs in response to COVID-19 have put an unprecedented workload on the banking industry. The small business funding programs like Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans and Small Business Administration (SBA) Bridge loans have generated 14 yearsâ€™ worth of applications in 13 days underscoring the importance of digital transformation.

In this project, we offer a solution to an example use case in support of that first principle. The example highlights the benefit of APIs to rapidly integrate disparate systems and the power of artificial intelligence (AI) in automating mundane tasks to accelerate the lending process.
